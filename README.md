ðŸ”¸ Project Title: Taco Sales Performance Dashboard (Power BI)
ðŸ”¸ Type: Self-Initiated Project | Dataset Source: [Kaggle]

ðŸ“Œ Description:
I designed an interactive Power BI dashboard using a synthetic dataset of 1,000 taco delivery orders across U.S. cities (2024â€“2025), sourced from Kaggle. This project aims to simulate real-world business scenarios in the food delivery industry and generate operational insights.

KPIs: Total Orders, Total Revenue, Avg. Delivery Time, Tip Percentage, Taco Types Count

Visuals & Insights:

Bar charts for top taco types and top locations by revenue

Monthly trend analysis for order volume

Donut chart to compare taco size preferences

Heatmap showing hourly order patterns by day of week

Interactive Elements:

Page navigation between summary dashboard and detailed data table

ðŸŽ¯ Outcome:
This dashboard helps track sales performance, understand customer preferences, identify peak ordering times, and analyze delivery efficiency. It reflects my skills in designing clean, informative, and interactive dashboards using Power BI.
